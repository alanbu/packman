Adjust on install does an immediate install (from Jess Hampshire)
GUI to edit Paths (needs LibPKG change above integrated first)
Enable/Disable an individual source- workarond for timeout
Download other list on timeout (from Grahame Parish)
  - I have three sources set and if any one of them is unavailable then no updates can be applied from any of the other sources. It would be useful to timeout a connection to a source and skip to the next one.  The only way round this is to remove the source from the list and update lists again, but it's not ideal.
Automatic - run update lists - ask if you want to upgrade and optionally exit (from Jess Hampshire).
Prompt to backup old software that's in the way. Martin Wuerthner martin@mw-software.com;
