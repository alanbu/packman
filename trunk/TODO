Use new LibPKG paths interface when it's released by Graham
Cancel processing during install/remove
Ensure panes are always at least as wide as the main window
Make it easier to see/install recommendations and suggestions
Sources window should not allow a second Update Lists window
to be run.
Check progress bar in update lists. Was 100% when it still
had more to do.
See why a failed install means you can't install anything new without the failed package turning up in the dependencies list.
Display of summary in main window is truncated if it goes beyond the size of the tool icon bar (need a very wide window to see this - Cache package entry from RPi list shows this).


Possible future changes (i.e. under consideration)
--------------------------------------------------

Adjust on install does an immediate install (from Jess Hampshire)
Enable/Disable an individual source- workarond for timeout
Download other list on timeout (from Grahame Parish)
  - I have three sources set and if any one of them is unavailable then no updates can be applied from any of the other sources. It would be useful to timeout a connection to a source and skip to the next one.  The only way round this is to remove the source from the list and update lists again, but it's not ideal.
Automatic - run update lists - ask if you want to upgrade and optionally exit (from Jess Hampshire).
Add option to check, repair or re-install packages (Jess Hampshire)
Add way to save list of what's installed so it can be used to restore a machine or set up another machine with the same packages (Jess Hampshire)
Theo Markettos - have PackMan say "your package list is XX days old, would you like to update?"
