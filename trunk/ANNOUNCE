Packman package manager 0.5 beta released

Packman version 0.5 beta is now available.

The main changes are:
 - Paths window showing where packages will be installed
 - Help entry added to iconbar and main window menus to launch
   the help from within the application.
 - Workaround to fix bug in RISC OS 4.39 Toolaction module
   to prevent a crash on this version of the OS.
 - Reduced version requirements for toolbox modules so it
   can be used from RISC OS 5/4 without having to download
   updated modules from the RISC OS Ltd site.

If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or updrade it from either of
these programs.

Otherwise go to http://alanb.drobe.co.uk/packman.htm for
download and installation instructions.
