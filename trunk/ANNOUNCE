PackMan is a package manager front end for packages distributed
using the RISC OS Packaging Project (see http://www.riscpkg.org).

It can be used instead of or alongside !RiscPkg.

Its features include:

- Summary and detailed description of the packages
- Filters to allow display of packages for a specific category,
  what's installed, what's new or upgrades to already installed
  packages.
- Search for a package.
- Single buttons to start an install, upgrade or removal of a package.
- Menu option to upgrade all your packages at once.
- Automatically install dependencies for you, always showing what
  is going to be installed.
- Install multiple packages at once.
- Install the components from (non fixed location) packages where you
  want (subject to a package upgrade that is ongoing). Older
  (non fixed location) packages can be moved after install.
