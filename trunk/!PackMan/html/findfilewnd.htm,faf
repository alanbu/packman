<H2>Find File Dialog</H2>
<P>The Find File dialog allows you to search all the package components or installed files
for a file.</P>
<P>This dialog will also be shown if a file (that is not a package or zip file) is dragged
to the !PackMan iconbar icon.</P>
<P>The results are shown in the <A HREF="findresultswnd.htm">Find Results Window</A> if there are more than one match or the
<A HREF="filefoundwnd.htm">File Found Window</A> if there is exactly one match. If no matches are found a message will be shown.</P>
<P>
The fields on the dialog are:
<UL>
<LI>Find - Enter the full path name or path leaf name</LI>
<LI>Search
<UL>
  <LI>Components only - Searches the components field of all the packages</LI>
  <LI>Installed files only - Searches the list of installed files</LI>
  <LI>Components then installed files - Searches components first and if there
  is no match, then searches the installed files</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Exact - When set, the the whole leaf names must match. If a path is entered
    in the find field, then that must match as well. When unset, only part of
    the leaf name needs to match, the directory name is ignored</LI>
<LI>Cancel - Close the dialog without looking for the file</LI>
<LI>Find - Search for the file and show the results</LI>
