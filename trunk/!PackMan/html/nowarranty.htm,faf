<H1>A Warning</H1>
<P>
  Package managers by their nature have the potential to do serious harm
  to your filesystem.  At this stage of its development, the risks posed
  by PackMan itself (as opposed to software you may choose to install
  using PackMan) are judged to be as follows:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>- failure of software that PackMan has installed: moderate</LI>
  <LI>- failure of other software: low but non-negligible</LI>
  <LI>- corruption or deletion of user data: very low</LI>
</UL>
<P>
  If you use your machine for any purpose where such failure could
  result in serious harm then it is strongly recommended that you make
  sufficiently frequent and regular backups of your programs and data
  to avoid such harm.
</P>
<H1>No Warranty</H1>
