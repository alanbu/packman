<H2>Files that conflict Window</H2>
<P>This Window is shown at the end of an Install or Update if it failed due to files already
existing on the hard disk that are also used in one of the packages to be installed.</P>
<P>You should move the conflicting files from their location on the hard disc to a location to
back them up and then retry the install or update.</P>
<P>When you first start using the Packaging system you are likely to see this message for
the various system modules. e.g. SharedUnixLibrary etc.</P>
