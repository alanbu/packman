<BODY>
<P>
PackMan is a utility to help install and maintain applications and other components
of a RISC OS computer.
</P>
<P>This is version 0.2 (first public Beta version).
It should be feature complete, but may contain some rough edges and
bugs. Please send me feedback to improve this application.
Contact details are in the application Help.
</P>
<P>This is an alternative frontend for packages in the
<A HREF="www.riscpkg.org">RISC OS Packaging Project</A> format.
</P>
<P>If you are already using !RiscPkg there is a PackMan package
you can install.</P>
<P>If you are not using !RiscPkg, you will need a program that can
decompress Zip files (e.g. !SparkPlug) and to have installed the
SharedUnixLibrary which is available from
<A HREF="http://www.riscos.info/packages/SupportDetails.html#SharedUnixLibrary">here.</A>
