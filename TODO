PackMan grabs focus away from other app during install (at end possibly).
 - I've looked at this but haven't figure out a way to fix it
Use new LibPKG paths interface when it's released by Graham
Cancel processing during install/remove

Possible future changes (i.e. under consideration)
--------------------------------------------------

Adjust on install does an immediate install (from Jess Hampshire)
Enable/Disable an individual source.
GUI to edit Paths (needs LibPKG change above integrated first)
