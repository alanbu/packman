Use new LibPKG paths interface when it's released by Graham
Cancel processing during install/remove
Ensure panes are always at least as wide as the main window


Possible future changes (i.e. under consideration)
--------------------------------------------------

Move update lists to window menu (from Jan-Jaap)
Add "updates" (maybe check for updates) to iconbar menu
that does an update lists and shows the updates window
with all selected ready to install (from Jan-Jaap).
For above would need install selected.

Adjust on install does an immediate install (from Jess Hampshire)
Enable/Disable an individual source.
GUI to edit Paths (needs LibPKG change above integrated first)
