PackMan grabs focus away from other app during install (at end possibly).
 - I've looked at this but haven't figure out a way to fix it
 - It's now been reported again so I'll need another look
 - It appears to be setting the selection in the TextArea in the Summary Window that grabs the focus. The set selection is needed so the top of the text is shown.
Use new LibPKG paths interface when it's released by Graham
Cancel processing during install/remove
Ensure panes are always at least as wide as the main window


Possible future changes (i.e. under consideration)
--------------------------------------------------

Move update lists to window menu (from Jan-Jaap)
Add "updates" (maybe check for updates) to iconbar menu
that does an update lists and shows the updates window
with all selected ready to install (from Jan-Jaap).
For above would need install selected.

Adjust on install does an immediate install (from Jess Hampshire)
Enable/Disable an individual source.
GUI to edit Paths (needs LibPKG change above integrated first)
