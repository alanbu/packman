PackMan grabs focus away from other app during install (at end possibly).
 - I've looked at this but haven't figure out a way to fix it
 - It's now been reported again so I'll need another look
Use new LibPKG paths interface when it's released by Graham
Cancel processing during install/remove
Ensure panes are always at least as wide as the main window
If you leave a download/install progress window open, after it finishes, and you try to install or remove another package the clicks on the menuitems are ignored.
- I think I should just automatically close the dialogue if a new install/remove is done.
OK on update lists leaves PackMan in an unstable state.
- Should do something with OK button (fade/rename?) until proper cancelling can be used.


Possible future changes (i.e. under consideration)
--------------------------------------------------

Move update lists to window menu (from Jan-Jaap)
Add "updates" (maybe check for updates) to iconbar menu
that does an update lists and shows the updates window
with all selected ready to install (from Jan-Jaap).
For above would need install selected.

Adjust on install does an immediate install (from Jess Hampshire)
Enable/Disable an individual source.
GUI to edit Paths (needs LibPKG change above integrated first)
