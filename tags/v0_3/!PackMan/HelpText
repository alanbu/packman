!PackMan 0.3 beta version

PackMan is an alternative front end to install,
update and remove packages for the RISC OS
Packaging Project (www.riscpkg.org).

Full documentation is shown in HTML files in
the html folder of the application directory.
It is recommended you use a browser for the
help. This file is just a summary.
If a browser has been seen by the filer the
HTML help should have been selected automatically.

This beta should contain all the features of
the final released program, but may have some
rough edges and bugs.

Installation:

On first run if the program can't find the modules
it needs it should tell you.

You are most likely to need the latest SharedUnixLibrary
from:

http://www.riscos.info/downloads/gccsdk/sharedunixlib/


A Warning

  Package managers by their nature have the potential to do serious harm
  to your filesystem.  At this stage of its development, the risks posed
  by PackMan itself (as opposed to software you may choose to install
  using PackMan) are judged to be as follows:

  - failure of software that PackMan has installed: moderate
  - failure of other software: low but non-negligible
  - corruption or deletion of user data: very low

  If you use your machine for any purpose where such failure could
  result in serious harm then it is strongly recommended that you make
  sufficiently frequent and regular backups of your programs and data
  to avoid such harm.

How to use:

Double click the application and you should get an
icon on the icon bar. Click on this icon to get the
main window.

This icon also allows you to update the list of
packages and quit the application.

The main window shows a list of the packages
available. You can filter the list by selecting
a category from the drop down on the toolbar
or clicking on Search and searching for text in
the package names and descriptions.

The left hand column is either:
- blank if the package is not installed
- a green tick if the package is installed
- an orangish tick if the package is installed and there
  is an upgrade available.

The ticks have a small "a" by them if the package was
automatically installed.

This is followed by the package name and a summary of
what it does.

Clicking on a package will show more information about
it in the status bar at the bottom of the Window.

To install or remove a package after selecting it click
on the Install or Remove button on the toolbar (the first
two icons respectively) or the menu.

You will be prompted if you are sure you with to install/remove
the package.

After confirming your choice a progress window should appear
and the package will be installed or removed.
