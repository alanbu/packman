<H2>Toolbar</H2>
<P>The toolbar runs across the top of the main menu and provides icons
to give short cuts to common features of PackMan and the filter that
allow you to show a subset of the packages.</P>
<P>The icons are faded if they are not currently available.
e.g. The first four need an item to be selected.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Install/Update icon - Installs or Updates the selected package.
