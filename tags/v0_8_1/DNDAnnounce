Feedback wanted for a drag-and-drop install location interface for PackMan

One of the most common complaints about PackMan is that it doesn't
allow you to specify where it installs applications.

This has been alleviated a little in later versions as it lets you move
applications after they have been installed or pre-set the install
directory for groups of items.

However, the next step would be to allow you to specify where you want
your apps before it installs them.

To this end I've create a simple test application called (TestDrag)
that shows my ideas for implementing this.

The download and a few screen shots can be found at:

This UI also includes options for adding application to Boot and Apps,
which I am also thinking about including when the drag-and-drop is
implemented.

Please take a look at this and send me any feedback on it - good or bad.
If you don't like it, alternative ideas would be greatly appreciated.
