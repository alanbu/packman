<LI>Drag the !PackMan application out of the zip archive onto the location
you want it installed. You could also just drag the Apps folder to your boot
disc which would put it in the default location of Apps.Admin.</LI>
<LI>Double click on !PackMan to run the application</LI>
<LI>Select "Update Lists" from the Iconbar icon menu.</LI>
<LI>If this is the first time you've run !PackMan (and you haven't used !RiscPkg before)
    you will be presented with a dialog box asking you to create the !Packages directory.
    It is recommended you accept the default location and press OK. Once the !Packages
    directory is installed you will be prompted to update the lists.
    If you do not want to do this immediately, you can say no and select Update Lists later.</LI>
<LI>A window will appear showing the progress of downloading the package lists.
    When it has finished click the "Close" button to close the Window.<LI>
<LI>Click on the icon bar to show the <A HREF="main.htm">Main Window</A> which allows
    you to install and remove packages</LI>
</UL>
<P>PackMan is automatically marked as being installed in the location you ran it
from. If you wish to move it later, use the move menu option from the <A HREF="apps.htm">Components
Window</A>.</P>
<P>PackMan requires the Shared Unix Library, but uses a copy in it's Resources directory
if one is not installed. This is so PackMan can be used without any further setup.</P>
<P>This can mean PackMan may fail with an error about the version of the Shared Unix Library
if an older version has already been installed in !System. If this happens please download the
latest version from <A HREF="http://www.riscos.info/packages/LibraryDetails.htm#SharedUnixLibrary">
http://www.riscos.info/packages/LibraryDetails.htm#SharedUnixLibrary</A> and copy it
to your !System.</P>
