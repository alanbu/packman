<H2>Cache Window</H2>

<P>The Cache Window allows you to clear the cache of downloaded
packages.</P>
<p>The packaging system downloads the packages to a cache before unpacking and
   installing them. Once installed the packages are left in the cache so they
   may be reinstalled at any time without having to download them again.</p>
<p>The cache is stored in the !Packages application you created when you first
installed the packaging system. If you are short of disc space on this drive
or are happy to download the package files again you can use this window to
clear all or just old versions from the cache.</p>
<p>The cache should not be modified when an install or remove is in progress.
If one has been started in !PackMan the buttons will be disabled when you
show this window. If this is the case you will need to reshow the window at
a later time to re-enable the buttons.</p>
<p>The window provides the following buttons</p>
<UL>
<LI>Clear All - Delete all downloaded packages from the cache</LI>
<LI>Clear Old Versions - Delete downloaded packages from the cache where
 a newer version of the package exists in the cache.</LI>
<LI>Close - Close the dialogue. Clicking outside of the Window will also close it.</LI>
