<H2>Boot Options Window</H2>
<P>This Window allows you to update the Boot Options for the selected application or file.</P>
<P>It is reached from the "Boot Options" menu item on the Applications Window.</P>
<P>The Boot Options specify the actions to take when RISC OS is booted (started).
 They can also be configured from the standard RISC OS configuration tool.</P>
<P>The window contains the following fields</P>
<ul>
<LI>Look at - the application will be booted so all its system variables are set up.
    This is useful for applications that are run when double clicking on a file type
    or command line utilities that are placed within an application folder.</LI>
<LI>Run - run the application on startup.</LI>
<LI>Add To Apps - the application will be added to the "Apps" folder on the iconbar.</LI>
<li>Cancel - close the window without updating the Boot Options.</li>
<LI>Apply - apply the selected options.</LI>
</ul>
<P>When setting the options PackMan will boot the application for the "Look At" and "Run" options
and add the applications to the "Apps" iconbar folder for the "Add To Apps" option immediately.</P>
<P>Clearing any of the options will set up the relevant boot files for next time RISC OS is restarted,
but does not clear any application variables or remove the application from the "Apps" folder.</P>
