Packman package manager 0.8.1 beta released with module checking and easier first install

Packman version 0.8.1 beta is now available.

New to this version:

- Module checking. If an existing RISC OS module has already been
  installed that matches the module in a Package, PackMan will use
  existing module to fulfil the request for the package and update
  it's database to reflect the found version.
  
- Easier first install experience. PackMan now marks itself
  installed in the location it's first run and uses it's own
  copy of the SharedUnixLibrary if one isn't already installed.
  It will also prompt if you want to update the package lists
  on this first run.
  
- Info window has been improved to show Components and can be
  accessed by double clicking on a package.

- Fixed documentation that was not referring correctly to the
  Components which were added last release.
  
- Added links to documentation on new features in !PackMan that
  have not been added to !RiscPkg.
  
+ An assortment of minor bug fixes and UI improvements (see the
  history page in the help for details) 

If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or upgrade it from either of
these programs.

Otherwise go to https://sites.google.com/site/alansriscosstuff/packman
for download and installation instructions.

PackMan is a package manager front end for packages distributed
using the RISC OS Packaging Project (see http://www.riscpkg.org).

It can be used instead of or alongside !RiscPkg.

Its features include:

- Summary and detailed description of the packages
- Filters to allow display of packages for a specific category,
  what's installed, what's new or upgrades to already installed
  packages.
- Search for a package.
- Single buttons to start an install, upgrade or removal of a package.
- Menu option to upgrade all your packages at once.
- Automatically install dependencies for you, always showing what
  is going to be installed.
- Install multiple packages at once.
- Install the components from (non fixed location) packages where you
  want (subject to a package upgrade that is ongoing). Older
  (non fixed location) packages can be moved after install.
