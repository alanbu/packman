<H2>Conflict Manager Window</H2>
<P>This Window is shown at the end of an Install or Update if it failed due to files already
existing on the hard disc that are also used in any of the packages to be installed.</P>
<P>It shows a list of applications/directories or individual files that conflict.
In the case of an application or directory the number of conflicting files inside are shown.
</P>
<P>The buttons at the bottom of the window are:
<ul>
<li><b>Show files</b> This button shows a full list of the files that conflict in the 
<a href="conflict.htm">Files that Conflict Window</a></li>
<li><b>Close</b> This button closes the Conflict Manager without taking any further action. This allows you to investigate or sort out the conflict by hand.</li>
<li><b>Backup and Retry</b> This button will attempt to make a backup of the conflicting
files and if this is successful it will retry the installation.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>When you first start using the Packaging system you are likely to see this message for
the various system modules. e.g. SharedUnixLibrary etc.</P>
