<P>When the Verify all option is selected it will first show a prompt
to check if you want to go ahead and do the verify.</P>
<p>The prompt informs you that the verify only checks that files exist
and not their contents and also that if you perform a remove, update
install or move while it is in progress it may give false results.</p>
<p>Select the "No" button if you do not want to do the verify at this
time.</p>
<p>If you select the "Yes" button the verify will run and show
a progress window to show how far it gets. You can stop the verify at
any time by pressing the cancel button.</p>
<p>At the end of the verify the progress window will close and you
will either see a message saying that all packages verified or if
one or more files were found to be missing the
