<H2>Paths where packages are installed</H2>

<p>This Window shows the paths where packages are installed by PackMan.</p>
<p>Each entry shows the Logical name of the path used in the package
along with the location on disc it is mapped to.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you leave the paths at their standard locations
and use stubs to gain access to application from other directories.
However it is appreciated that some people prefer their own disc layout
or have multiple discs and want some packages installed on other discs.</p>

<p>The <b>Open</b> button will open a filer window for the currently
selected path. If the path contains the special "@" character it is not
possible to open the path in this way so a message will be shown instead.</p>

<p>The <b>Move</b> button allows you to move the logical path to refer to
a new location. It only allows this if the current location is not part of
the !Boot structure.</p>
<p>When "Move" is selected it shows a window that allows you to specify the
new location of the path. Type in a new name and/or drag the folder icon
to the new location. Once dragged or the Save button is pressed the
<a href="movepathwnd.htm">Move Path Window</a> will be shown and any
files installed in the old path will be moved to the new path.
A check that that no files will be overwritten is done as part
of this process.</p>

<p>The <b>Add</b> button allows you to add a new logical path to the
list of paths. The path added must be a child of another logical path.
A new window will be opened in which you can enter the logical path
name and the new location. Dragging the folder icon to a filer directory
will fill in the directory for the new location.
Once dragged or the Save button is pressed the
<a href="movepathwnd.htm">Move Path Window</a> will be shown and any
files installed at or below the new logical path will be checked to
see if they need to be moved and then moved to the new location on
disc if necessary.
A check that no files will be overwritten is done as part
of this process.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to have all the games in a the $.Games directory
instead of in the default $.Apps.Games directory on your disc. To do this add a new path called
Apps.Games, set the location to Games and drag the directory folder to the $ directory
on your hard disc. Any games you already have installed into $.Apps.Games will
be moved to $.Games. Any game installed after this will be placed
in the $.Games directory.</p>

<p>The <b>Remove</b> button allows you to remove an existing logical path from the
list of paths. Only paths that are the child of another logical path can be removed.
You will be prompted to check you are sure you wish to remove the path
and if you continue the
<a href="movepathwnd.htm">Move Path Window</a> will be shown and any
files installed which were in the removed path will have there location on
disc reevaluated and will be moved if necessary.
A check that no files will be overwritten is done as part
of this process. If the directory for the path doesn't exist on disc
the logical path will be deleted without showing the Move Path Window.</p>

<p>The <b>Show Definitions</b> option button toggles the display between
showing the path used and the definition of the path in the <code>Paths</code> file.</p>


<h2>Changing the paths manually</h2>

<p>The installation paths should normally be changed through the PackMan
user interface, but if you want to do it manually use the following instructions.
This is not recommended for anything but the <code>Apps</code>
and <code>Manuals</code> paths.</p>

<p>The file <code>!Boot.Resources.!Packages.Paths</code> contains a list of mappings
from logical to physical pathnames.  Logical pathnames are those used within
the package file.  For example, <code>System.310.Modules.CLib</code> refers
to a location within the active <code>!System</code> folder without making
any assumption as to the physical location of that folder.</p>
<p>Each line of the <code>paths</code> file consists of a logical pathname,
followed by an equals-sign, followed by a physical pathname.
These components must be separated by whitespace.  For example:</p>
<p><code>RiscPkg = &lt;Packages$Dir&gt;.Info.@<br>
Apps = &lt;Boot$Dir&gt;.^.Apps<br>
System = &lt;System$Dir&gt;<br>
SysVars = &lt;Packages$Dir&gt;.SysVars<br></code></p>
<p>Comments are introduced by a hash character.  Blank lines are ignored.
Each logical and physical pathname acts as the root of a sub-tree and
applies to any file within that sub-tree.  If two or more logical pathnames
match then the longest one is used.  An at-sign is converted into the name
of the package to which the file belongs, so the file
<code>RiscPkg.Control</code> from the package <code>Foo</code> would
become <code>&lt;Packages$Dir&gt;.Info.Foo.Control</code>.</p>
<p>In principle you are free to choose any mappings you wish and the package
manager will act accordingly.  In practice, the scope for doing so is fairly
limited if you want installed packages to work afterwards.  The best way to
ensure correct behaviour is to refer to locations indirectly using system
variables.  For example, the mapping given above for <code>System</code>
will work even if the system folder moves.</p>
<p>One path that is freely changable is <code>Apps</code>.  This is where
applications are installed, and there is no requirement for them to be
placed in any particular location.  However the location you choose should
not be used for any other purpose: if you want to mix applications and user
data in the same directory then create symbolic links to the applications.
</p>
<p>If you supply a <code>Paths</code> file then it takes precedence over
the default but does not necessarily replace it.  Any paths that you do
not specify will continue to use the default mapping.</p>
<p>Be aware that if you change the <code>Paths</code> file while there are
packages installed, you must make corresponding changes to the physical
filesystem (otherwise <code>PackMan</code> will not be able to perform
upgrades correctly). If you use the PackMan "Move" button above it
will update the filesystem for you.</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b>Older versions of !PackMan (0.6 and earlier) 
and !RiscPkg (0.4.0 and earlier) had their own choices folder
with their own copies of the <code>Paths</code> file. You should
upgrade both programs so they share a common paths file.</p>
