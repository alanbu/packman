Packman package manager 0.7.1 beta released

Packman version 0.7.1 beta is now available.

New to this version:

- What's new filter shows all the packages that are new to you.

- Enable/Disable individual sources for a package list. If for some
  reason one of your package list becomes temporarily unavailable
  this allows you to easily switch them off and back on again.

- Add/Remove paths. With this change you can now set the default
  directories for whole categories of packages.

- The default sources for the packages list with a new install have
  been changed to the those provided by ROOL. This will not affect
  existing users. If existing users want to change to the new lists,
  please go to the sources window and update the paths there. A new
  help page has been added to show what the most common available
  sources of packages are as a reference. 

- and other minor bug fixes and improvements. The full history can
  be seen in the help file.

If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or upgrade it from either of
these programs.
