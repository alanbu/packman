<P>
Clicking on the main icon bar icon will show you a the
<A HREF="main.htm">Main Window</A>.
</P>
<P>
From this window you can display all the packages, just those of
a particular type or search for a package.
</P>
<P>
Once you have a package you are interested in visible, just select it
with the mouse and you can install/upgrade or remove it through the
toolbar or the main windows menu.</P>
<P>Most packages contain a component (file, directory or application) that you
can set the installation location for from the 
<A HREF="configpackage.htm">Configure Package Window</A>, which is shown
when you install, upgrade or remove a package. A default location, which
is usually a subdirectory of the Apps directory on the drive with the !Boot
application on it, is shown to speed up the installation process for users
happy with the suggested disc layout.</P>
<P>After a component is installed you can easily see where it was put
by looking in <A HREF="info.htm">Info Window</A> or the
<A HREF="apps.htm">Components Window</A>.</P>

<P>The information for the packages comes from lists held on the
internet. New lists can be added to the lists used from the
<A HREF="sources.htm">Sources Window</A> available from the
icon bar menu.
</P>
<P>To update !PackMan with the latest information from these lists
select the Update lists options from the
<A HREF="iconbar.htm">Iconbar</A> menu.
