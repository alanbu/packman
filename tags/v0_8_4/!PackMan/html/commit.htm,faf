<P>If the operation completes successfully. Click on the button to dismiss it.</P>
<p>If new packages have been added to the your list of packages the "What's New..." button will be enabled.
This button will open a <a href="main.htm">Main Window</a> with the filter set to "What's new".
</p>
<p>If the one or more upgrades to already installed packages are detected in the new
lists the Upgrade All button will be enabled that leads to the
<a href="configpackage.htm">Configure Package Window</a> where all the upgrades available will
have been added so they can easily all be applied at once.</p>
<P>If the operation fails an error window will be shown with the cause of the failure.</P>
<P>If the failure is caused because there are already files in the location it would like
to install files in one of the installed packages the <A HREF="conflictman.htm">Conflict Manager Window</A>
showing information on the conflicting files will be shown instead.</P>
