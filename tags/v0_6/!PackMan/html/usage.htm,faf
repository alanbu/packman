<P>
Clicking on the main icon bar icon will show you a the
<A HREF="main.htm">Main Window</A>.
</P>
<P>
From this window you can display all the packages, just those of
a particular type or search for a package.
</P>
<P>
Once you have a package you are interested in visible, just select it
with the mouse and you can install/upgrade or remove it through the
toolbar or the main windows menu.</P>
<P>Most packages are installed into a subdirectory of the Apps directory
on the drive with the !Boot application on it. Although the applications
are installed in these fixed places, you can easily create
links to them anywhere on your filing systems using the create stub
or links option on the <A HREF="apps.htm">Apps Window</A> menu.</P>
<P>The menu also allows you to find out more information on the selected
package and show the location where an application was installed
(using the Apps Window mentioned above).
</P>

<P>The information for the packages comes from lists held on the
internet. New lists can be added to the lists used from the
<A HREF="sources.htm">Sources Window</A> available from the
icon bar menu.
</P>
<P>To update !PackMan with the latest information from these lists
select the Update lists options from the
<A HREF="iconbar.htm">Iconbar</A> menu.
