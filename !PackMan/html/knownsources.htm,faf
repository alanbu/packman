<H2>Known Sources</H2>

<P>This page list the main sources that the PackMan author knew of
at the time of this release of PackMan.</P>
<P>Multiple sources can be selected and where a package is on two or more
lists the latest version of the package will be used.</P>
<P>In late 2012, RISC OS Open created a set of packaging lists.
See <A HREF="http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages">http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages</A>.
It is recommend that these lists are now used.
<UL>
<LI><B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/programs-armv5</B>
 - ARMv5 programs and libraries suitable hardware with ARMv5 compatability
(this includes the Raspberry Pi in compatibility mode). This
list is an edited list of packages from the riscpkg and autobuilder lists below
which have had some testing on the Raspberry Pi. A lot of these programs will
also be compatible with ARMv7 and later machines as well. This is a synonym for
the <B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/raspberrypi-programs-armv5</B>
 list setup by default with the Raspberry Pi SD Images.
</LI>
<LI><B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/thirdparty</B>
- User-contributed ARMv7 programs and libraries suitable for Raspberry Pi and other
machines with the ARMv7 or later processor. This is a synonym for
the <B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/raspberrypi-programs-armv7</B>
 list setup by default with the Raspberry Pi SD Images.
This list is also a synonym of <B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/programs-armv7</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/rool</B> - This is a list for the nightly
builds of the applications for the RISC OS 5 disc image.
</LI>
<LI><B>http://www.jaspp.org.uk/packages/release</B> - This list provides older games that
can be run on newer systems either natively or using ADFFS. See <A HREF="https://forums.jaspp.org.uk">JASPP - The Archimedes Software Preservation Project for details.</A>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The older lists add more packages, but they may not have been tested on
the modern (post Iyonix) hardware so should be treated with caution. They should
be fine on Risc PC (RISC OS 4.0 or greater) and Iyonix computers.
<UL>
<LI><b>http://www.riscpkg.org/pkg/Unstable</b> - This was the main packaging
list.
This list comes from the <A HREF="http://www.riscpkg.org">RISC OS Packaging
Project</A>.</LI>
<LI><b>http://www.riscos.info/packages/pkg/autobuilt</b> - This contains a useful
list of ported applications, games, libraries and the latest GCC compiler.
See the <A HREF="http://www.riscos.info/index.php/Packages">Packages</A>
page at www.riscos.info for more details.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The following two Rapsberry Pi list do not seem to be kept up to date currently.
They are included here for reference in case this changes.
<UL>
<LI><B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/raspberrypi-system</B>
- Core system packages for the Raspberry Pi RISC OS distribution. This list
is for use with the Raspberry Pi computer only.
</LI>
<LI><B>http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/raspberrypi-testing</B>
- New system components that are under test (may break your system).
