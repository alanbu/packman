</LI>

<LI><B>0.9.5 Beta - April 2020</B>
 <UL>
   <LI>Increased WimpSlot so PackMan will start on RISC OS 4.</LI>
   <LI>Added environment for initial internal install of PackMan.</LI>
   <LI>Made SharedUnixLibrary a recommendation instead of a dependency for PackMan to stop it trying to uninstall PackMan on first run.</LI>
   <LI>Upgraded to use LibPkg 0.8.3 (the packaging library) which had the following fixes.
     <UL>
       <LI>Fixed arm environment detection for 26 bit machines.</LI>
       <LI>Added arm32 environment support.</LI>

     </UL>
   </LI>
 </UL>
</LI>

<LI><B>0.9.4 Beta - March 2020</B>
 <UL>
   <LI>Fixed package list displaying incorrect status/information when the environment is
       different in a new version of a package.</LI>
   <LI>Fixed update lists downloading nothing if the Sources file had never been changed by the user.
       E.g. This meant the package list was not updating on a fresh install.</LI>
   <LI>Fixed non-packaged modules being overwritten when their version was greater than the package version.</LI>
   <LI>Fixed the times that were displayed in the Log.</LI>
 </UL>
</LI>

<LI><B>0.9.3 Beta - March 2020</B>
 <UL>
   <LI>Fix PackMan disappearing from the package list after updating from an earlier version.
       This bug would also affect any other package that was installed with a previous version,
       but had the new environment field set.</LI>
 </UL>
</LI>
<LI><B>0.9.2 Beta - January 2020</B>
 <UL>
   <LI>Support for the new environment/modules field in packages to show
only the packages that are suitable for the machine PackMan is running on.</LI>
   <LI>Packages can now have a web homepage where more information on them can
be found. PackMan will display this page and has a button to allow it to be launched.</LI>

a "Quit" button on the dialogue allows PackMan to be exited. Previously there
was no way to exit PackMan until !Packages was installed.</LI>
  <LI>Fixed bug with Upgrade All during the first run of PackMan to set it up.
 If there was a newer version of PackMan online, the Upgrade All option
 from the Update Lists dialogue would lead to the Install window with an invalid
 Package Name. Also, the Upgrade All option from the menu would say there were
 no upgrades.</LI>
 </UL>
</LI>

<LI>Fixed creating of PackMan choices directory for save of the "WhatsNew" list</LI>
