<H2>Main Window</H2>

<P>
The main window shows a list of the packages
available. You can filter the list by selecting
a category from the drop down on the toolbar
or clicking on Find and searching for text in
the package names and descriptions.
</P>

<P>
The left hand column is either:
<UL>
<LI>blank if the package is not installed</LI>
<LI>a green tick if the package is installed</LI>
<LI>an orangish tick if the package is installed and there
  is an upgrade available.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The ticks have a small "a" by them if the package was
automatically installed.
</P>
<P>
This is followed by the package name and a summary of
what it does.
</P>
<P>
Clicking on a package will show more information about
it in the status bar at the bottom of the Window. The
small triangle on the right of the status bar allows it
to be shrunk (and expanded afterwards) to allow more
packages to be shown in the main view.
</P>
<P>
To install or remove a package after selecting it click
on the Install or Remove button on the <A HREF="toolbar.htm">toolbar</A>
(the first two buttons respectively) or the menu.
</P>
<P>
You will be prompted with the <A HREF="install.htm">Install Window</A>
or <A HREF="remove.htm">Remove Window</A> to confirm you are sure you wish
to install or remove the package before the installation/removal proceeds.
</P>
<P>Once a package has been installed or removed the main window
will be updated to show it's new status</P>

<P>Using the Menu button on the main window shows a menu with the
   following options</P>
<UL>
<LI>App "app_name" or Selection. This is a submenu that allows you to install,
 remove and view details on the selected package(s). For details see the
 <A HREF="appmenu.htm">Application Menu</A>.</LI>
 <LI>Upgrade All - Leads to the <a href="upgradeall.htm">Upgrade All</a> dialogue that lists the packages
   that will be upgraded and
   lets you upgrade them all in one go. If no upgrades are available this option
   will be faded. If there are no upgrades available you may
   want to run the Update Lists option from the icon bar to see if any new
   upgrades have appeared since the last time you updated the lists.</LI>
<LI>Search - This leads to the <A HREF="search.htm">search dialog<A>.</LI>
<LI>Help - This launches the Help file to show help on PackMan.</LI>
