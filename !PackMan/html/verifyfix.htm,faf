<H2>How to fix verify problems</H2>
<P>These instructions are shown from the help and the "How to Fix" button
on the verify failed window.</P>
<P>A verify all menu option checks if any files in any installed
package are not in the location they were initially installed to. It
does not check the contents of the files. If there are missing files
it is usually caused because the files were deleted or moved
outside of PackMan so it could not update the package database with
the new location or state of the files.</P>
<P>The simplest way to fix these problems is to remove and then
reinstall the package(s) with missing files in PackMan.</P>
<P>If you intended just to delete the files anyway, just removing the
package using PackMan is sufficient. PackMan has no trouble removing
non-existant files and will remove any other files still remaining
in the package and remove it from the package database.</P>
<P>If you have moved the files to another location, as an alternative
you can move them back to the location that PackMan expects them in,
so it's database of file locations matches the hard disc.</P>
<P>If you really wanted the files stored in the location they were at
before you had moved them to match the package database you can go to
the Apps Window and move the files back again using PackMan.
This will update the package database of file locations so it can
successfully update and remove the package in the future. It is
recommended to leave the files in the default location and use the
Stub applications to put shortcuts to them in other locations.</P>
