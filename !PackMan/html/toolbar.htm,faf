<H2>Toolbar</H2>
<P>The toolbar runs across the top of the main menu and provides icons
to give short cuts to common features of PackMan and the filter that 
allow you to show a subset of the packages.</P>
<P>The icons are faded if they are not currently available.
e.g. The first four need an item to be selected.</P>
<P>The items on the toolbar are (from left to right):
<UL>
<LI>Install/Update icon - Installs or Updates the selected package.
 A green arrow on the icon pointing right is an install, an orange one
 pointing up is an upgrade. Selecting on the icon shows the
 <A HREF="configpackage.htm">Configure Package Window</A> with the selected package added to it for installation/upgrade</LI>
<LI>Remove icon - Removes the selected package. Selecting the icon shows 
the <A HREF="configpackage.htm">Configure Package Window</A> with the selected package added to it for removal</LI>
<LI>Components icon - Shows the <A HREF="apps.htm">Components Window</A>
which shows you what components are in an installed package and
allows you to view their location and create links to them.</LI>
<LI>Info icon - Show information about the package in the
 <A HREF = "info.htm">Package information window</A></LI>
<LI>Search icon - show the <A HREF="search.htm">Search Window</A> that
allows the package names text to be searched.</LI>
<LI>Status filter - select the arrow by the side of the current filter
and it shows a menu, which allows you to filter the packages displayed 
by their status (installed, upgrades, What's New)</LI>
<LI>Section filter - select the arrow by the side of the current filter
and it shows a menu, which allows you to filter the packages displayed 
by the section of the package or the results of the last search.
The two filters work together to restrict the list to packages that
are only in the two current selections. e.g. If the status filter is set
to "Installed" and the section filter is set to "Desktop" then the main
display will show only those packages that have been installed and are
in the Desktop section.</LI>
</UL>
