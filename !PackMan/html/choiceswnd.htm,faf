<H2>Choices Window</H2>
<P>The choices window allows you to set various options for PackMan.</P>
The choices on the window are:
<UL>
<LI>Prompt for Update Lists on startup - This sets a reminder window to show after the given period of time after the last successful Package Lists Update. Choose the required period for the reminder (or "Never" if you do not want a reminder) from the list.
</LI>
<LI>Enable logging - Turns on or off the logging of the Update Lists and Commit (Install/Remove/Upgrade) actions. To view the log created use the "View Log" menu option from the Advanced menu.
</LI>
<LI>Use Proxy - Set to turn on the use of a proxy server when downloading packages and package lists.
 Use the following two field to configure the proxy server.</LI>
<LI>Server - set the proxy to use for downloads.  The proxy should be host name or dotted numerical IP address.
    To specify port number in this string, append :[port] to the end of the host name. The proxy's port number may optionally be specified with the separate option CURLOPT_PROXYPORT. If not specified, PackMan will default to using port 1080 for proxies.
    The proxy string may be prefixed with [scheme]:// (e.g. http:// or https://).
</LI>
<LI>Do not proxy - A list of a comma separated host names that do not require a proxy
 to get reached, even if one is specified.
  Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the hostname itself. For example, example.com would match example.com, example.com:80, and www.example.com, but not www.notanexample.com or example.com.othertld.
  If the name in the noproxy list has a leading period, it is a domain match against the provided host name. This way ".example.com" will switch off proxy use for both "www.example.com" as well as for "foo.example.com".
</LI>
<LI>Cancel - Close the window without updating the choices.</LI>
<LI>OK - Update and save the choices</LI>
</UL>
