<H2>Applications Window</H2>

<P>This Window shows all the application that are installed as part of
a package (it there are any).</P>
<P>Select a package and press menu to see the following menu options.
<UL>
<LI>Create stub - create an application stub. This will forward the Help, Boot and Run
actions for an application to the real application and can be used as a short cut
to the application from another location on the disc</LI>
<LI>Create link - create a LinkFS symbolic link</LI>
<LI>Copy - make a copy the application</LI>
>LI>Move - move the application to another location. The preferred way of using PackMan is to use a stub to the default install location, however it is understood that this does not give the flexibility some users require, so this option has been added. Checks are made that the application isn't moved into itself and then the <a href="movewnd">Move window</a> is displayed to show the progress of the move.</LI>
<LI>Boot - Run the applications !Boot file</LI>
<LI>Run - Run the application</LI>
<LI>Help - Show the applications Help file</LI>
<LI>View - Open the directory that contains the application.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<p>You can also run the application by double clicking on its icon. If you use the adjust
mouse button instead of the select mouse button the Applications Window will be
closed after the application is run.</p>
<p>Dragging an application icon to the filer will also create an application stub.</p>
