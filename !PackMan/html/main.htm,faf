<H2>Main Window</H2>

<P>
The main window shows a list of the packages
available. You can filter the list by selecting
a status and/or category from the drop down lists on the toolbar
or clicking on Find and searching for text in
the package names and descriptions.
</P>

<P>
The left hand column is either:
<UL>
<LI>blank if the package is not installed</LI>
<LI>a green tick if the package is installed</LI>
<LI>an orangish tick if the package is installed and there
  is an upgrade available.</LI>
<LI>A rectangle partially filled with green from the left during package installation/removal. If this appears while packages are not being installed it means the install failed and did not manage to fully restore the original state. The best solution to this is to remove the package and then try reinstalling it again. Alternatively a second attempt at installing has a good chance of continuing from where the install failed. Packages in this state will be added to the next Package Configuration Window shown until they are fixed.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The ticks have a small "a" by them if the package was
automatically installed.
</P>
<P>
This is followed by the package name, the environment status, and a summary of
what it does.
</P>
<P>The environment status can be one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>blank if the package is suitable for the current environment</LI>
<LI>A red triangle containing a question mark if the package does not
have any environment information</LI>
<LI>A red triangle containing an exclamation mark if the package is not
suitable for the current environment. These packages are only shown
if they were installed before the environment was first detected or
if it changed.</LI>
<LI>A red triangle containing a "x" if the current version of PackMan
does not understand the environment information in the package.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Clicking on a package will show more information about
it in the status bar at the bottom of the Window. The
small triangle on the right of the status bar allows it
to be shrunk (and expanded afterwards) to allow more
packages to be shown in the main view.
</P>
<P>
To install or remove a package after selecting it click
on the Install or Remove button on the <A HREF="toolbar.htm">toolbar</A>
(the first two buttons respectively) or the menu.
</P>
<P>
You will be prompted with the <A HREF="configpackage.htm">Configure Packages Window</A>
 to confirm you are sure you wish to install or remove the packages before the installation/removal proceeds.
If the <A HREF="configpackage.htm">Configure Packages Window</A> is already showing the selected packages
will be added to it.
</P>
<P>Once a package has been installed or removed the main window
will be updated to show it's new status</P>

<P>Using the Menu button on the main window shows a menu with the
   following options</P>
<UL>
<LI>Package "app_name" or Selection. This is a submenu that allows you to install,
 remove and view details on the selected package. For details see the
 <A HREF="appmenu.htm">Package Menu</A>.</LI>
 <LI>Upgrade All - Leads to the <A HREF="configpackage.htm">Configure Packages Window</A> with all the the packages
   that will be upgraded and added to it. If no upgrades are available this option
   will be faded. If there are no upgrades available you may
   want to run the Update Lists option from the icon bar to see if any new
   upgrades have appeared since the last time you updated the lists.</LI>
 <LI>Update Lists - This downloads the latest versions of the package lists that are used to
   provide the list of packages that are available. It shows a window to indicate
   the progress of the List update. This Window also contains an "Upgrade All"
   button that is enabled after the download of the lists if there are any
   upgrades available and a "What's New" button to show any packages added since the
   last update lists.
 </LI>
<LI>Search - This leads to the <A HREF="search.htm">search dialog<A>.</LI>
<LI>Save Position - This will save the current position of the main window and
the size of the summary bar to your choices. When you next show a window it will
be displayed at the saved position</LI>
<LI>Help - This launches the Help file to show help on PackMan.</LI>
