<P>This Window is shown from the Conflict Manager Window "Show Files" button. It lists all the files
that already existed on the hard disc that are also used in one of the packages to be installed.</P>
<P>You should move the conflicting files from their location on the hard disc to a location to
back them up and then retry the install or update. You can do this manually or use the
Conflict Manager Window that this Window was shown from.</P>
