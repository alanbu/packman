I'm the one making the relicensing request so am happy for the contributions I made to be relicensed.

That's OK with me, especially if it gives the code a bit more life after all this time.

I can't remember which I contributed to, but I'm very happy for you to
change the licence of my contributions to Apache v2.

Richard,
 
A while ago you provided new and improved icons for PackMan. I would like to change PackMan’s license to the Apache License 2. Is it OK with you to ship your icons under this new license? 

Regards,
Alan

Hello Alan,

Yes, of course. No problem at all.
