# PackMan
PackMan is a package manager front-end for the RISC OS operating system that uses the LibPkg back-end.

It is used to find, install, remove and upgrade software on RISC OS.
For PackMan to find the software, it must have been put in the correct format and uploaded to a location that provides an index off all the packages at that location.

Details of the Packaging Project can be found at www.riscpkg.org.

The latest package list are held at RISC OS Open (www.riscosopen.org), for details of the lists see http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/.
