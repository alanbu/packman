| Pre Desktop setup activities. This file gets Obeyed before the desktop starts.
|
| When modifying the file by adding a section of lines it is recommended that
| the lines be bracketed by lines which start with |Start and |End. In this way
| it is easy to identify sections of line which shouldn't be broken up. For
| application writers who want to install a section of lines we advise that
| your company, application, version and section be identified. This enables
| a future install or update program to easily identify the section of lines
| which needs changing.
