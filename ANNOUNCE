PackMan package manager 0.9.0 beta released

PackMan version 0.9.0 beta is now available.

New to this version:

- Added find file window to search packages for a component or installed
  file.
- Added save/load install list of packages, paths and sources.
- Added install/remove/copyright and components buttons to the information
  window.
- Implemented package triggers.
- Fixed bug that corrupted desktop file if it did not contain any RISCOS
  sections. Modern RISC OS 4/5 !Boot directories would not trigger this
  bug, however earlier versions of the Iyonix may and if this file was
  a copy from a pre RISC OS 4 machine.
    
+ An assortment of minor bug fixes and UI improvements (see the
  history page in the help for details) 

If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or upgrade it from either of
these programs.
