PackMan package manager 0.9.1 beta released

PackMan version 0.9.1 beta is now available.

The main reason for this release is to allow PackMan to run on the
Raspberry Pi 3.

New to this version:

- Recompiled with a new version of the GCCSDK for Raspberry Pi 3 compatibility.
- Fixed bug where it was impossible to exit PackMan when it was first run
  without installing the Packages directory.

If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or upgrade it from either of
these programs.

The latest versions of PackMan are now distributed via the ROOL packaging
sites. RiscPkg and the older versions of PackMan may not have these
sources in the list of sources. If this version of PackMan doesn't appear
as an update in your browser you probably need to add the following url
to the PackMan sources.
