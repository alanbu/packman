Packman package manager 0.8 beta released with set install location

Packman version 0.8 beta is now available.

New to this version:

- New configuration window to allow multiple packages to be
  installed/removed/upgraded at once.

- Understands new Package format that allows the location to
  install components of the selected packages to be specified
  before the installation starts.

  Packages will need to be updated to the new format
  before this is available for them. I intend to do this
  for the packages I maintain soon. Details of what is
  required for other developers can be found at:
  https://sites.google.com/site/alansriscosstuff/packman/packagecomponents

- Allows configuration of the standard RISC OS boot options for
  a component of a package (i.e. look at, run and add to apps).

- Drop a package file onto the iconbar icon and it's automatically
  added to the configuration window, ready to install.


If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or upgrade it from either of
these programs.

Otherwise go to https://sites.google.com/site/alansriscosstuff/packman
for download and installation instructions.

PackMan is a package manager front end for packages distributed
using the RISC OS Packaging Project (see http://www.riscpkg.org).

It can be used instead of or alongside !RiscPkg.

Its features include:

- Status bar showing more information on the selected package.
- Filters to allow display of packages for a specific category,
  what's installed or upgrades to already installed packages.
- Search for a package.
- Single buttons to start an install, upgrade or removal of a package.
- Menu option to upgrade all your packages at once.

System requirements

RISC OS 4.0 or greater with long filenames
Internet connection for downloading packages
