PackMan package manager 0.9.2 beta released

PackMan version 0.9.2 beta is now available.

The main reason for this release is to allow PackMan to filter the lists
of packages to show only those that should be able to run in the environment
PackMan is running in.

This will need package authors to update their packages with this information
so currently this means you will get a warning triangle by the package name
to indicate nothing is specified about the environment for most packages.

It also allows package authors to release multiple versions of a package of
the same version targetted at different environments. e.g. a standard version
and a version that runs better with VFP hardware on the machine.

Package Maintainers, please add the new Enviroment field when you create a
new package or update an existing package.

Also in this version:

- Packages can include a Homepage field to give a link to more information
  about the packaged software and PackMan will show this link with a
  button to launch it in your (AcornURL compatible) web browser.
- Empty directories can now be included in packages.
- Help text fixes contributed by a PackMan user.

If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or upgrade it from either of
these programs.

The latest versions of PackMan are now distributed via the ROOL packaging
sites. RiscPkg and the older versions of PackMan may not have these
sources in the list of sources. If this version of PackMan doesn't appear
as an update in your browser you probably need to add the following url
to the PackMan sources.
http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/programs-armv5

Otherwise go to https://sites.google.com/site/alansriscosstuff/packman
for download and installation instructions.
