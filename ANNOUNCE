PackMan package manager 0.9.5 beta released

PackMan version 0.9.5 beta is now available.

The main reason for this release is to clear up some issues that were
discovered with the 0.9.2 release and the first attempts to fix them
in the 0.9.3 & 0.9.4 release.

If you have installed 0.9.2, 0.9.3 or 0.9.4 you are strongly advised
to upgrade to 0.9.5.

If the 0.9.5 release doesn't appear when you do an update lists in
your current version of PackMan you may need to download it again from
the page mentioned below.

Package Maintainers, the new Enviroment field now has a new
arm32 bit environment for 32 bit RISC OS machines (e.g. The
Iyonix onwards) and the arm environment has had the wording updated
to make it clear it is for assembler/compiled code that is
26/32 neutral.

A brief description of the new Environment field can be found at.

If you already have a previous version of !PackMan or !RiscPkg
installed you can install it or upgrade it from either of
these programs (but see the note above for 0.9.2, 0.9.3 or 0.9.4).

The latest versions of PackMan are now distributed via the ROOL packaging
sites. RiscPkg and the older versions of PackMan may not have these
sources in the list of sources. If this version of PackMan doesn't appear
as an update in your browser you probably need to add the following url
to the PackMan sources.
http://packages.riscosopen.org/packages/pkg/programs-armv5
