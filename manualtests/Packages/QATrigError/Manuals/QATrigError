This is a simple test package that contains all
the triggers.

It is used for testing error handling during
installation.

The triggers don't do anything except fail is
certain environmental variables are set.

To force an error at each stage set the following
variables to 1.
QATrigError$PreInstall
QATrigError$PreRemove
QATrigError$PostInstall
QATrigError$PostRemove
