Manual testing for Triggers
===========================

Generating the test packages
----------------------------

Go to the Packages subfolder.
Run the obey file !MakePkgs
make and zip must have been seen by the filer.

Resetting for testing.
----------------------

Ensure the package for testing is removed via PackMan.
Update the lists and ensure it is no longer in the package lists.
If necessary (i.e. the package has changed) delete it from the cache.

Logging
-------
For all the test you need to turn on logging in PackMan so the log can be checked to ensure the triggers are run correctly.
Each test will have a section the "log should contain entries". This will show lines that should be in the log and in the order they should appear in the log. If the lines are missing or shown in a different order the test has failed. The date has been removed from the beginning of the lines.


Trigger success testing
-----------------------

This uses the test package "QATriggers"

Test install triggers
---------------------
Drag the QATriggers_0/1-1 package to the PackMan iconbar icon.
Install it.
The package should install correctly.
The log should contain entries:
...
3003d Running pre-install trigger for package 'QATriggers'
...
3003e Trigger output: Trigger succeeded
...
3003d Running post-install trigger for package 'QATriggers'
...
3003e Trigger output: Trigger succeeded
...

Test remove triggers
--------------------
Remove it.
The package should remove correctly.
The log should contain entries:
...
30041 Preserving post-remove triggers
3003f Running pre-remove triggers
3003d Running pre-remove trigger for package 'QATriggers'
...
3003e Trigger output: Trigger succeeded
...
3003d Running post-remove trigger for package 'QATriggers'
...
3003e Trigger output: Trigger succeeded
30044 Removing copied post-remove triggers
...
30018 Package changes completed

Test upgrade triggers
---------------------
Install it again.
Drag the QATrigger_0/2-1 package to the PackMan iconbar icon.
Upgrade the existing package.
The upgrade should complete successfully.
The log should contain entries:

...
30041 Preserving post-remove triggers
3003f Running pre-remove triggers
3003d Running pre-remove trigger for package 'QATriggers'

...
3003e Trigger output: Trigger succeeded
30044 Removing copied post-remove triggers
...
30018 Package changes completed


Trigger failure testing
-----------------------

This uses the test package "QATrigError" and Obey files in the "SetFail" directory which cause various triggers to fail depending on the settings of some QATrigError environmental variables.

If you have run the test before run the script "SetFail.ClearFailures" to ensure the failure variables are all reset.

Test pre-install failure
------------------------
Run the obey file "SetFail.FailPreinstall".
